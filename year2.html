												As part of my individual assignment for the Database System Administration module in my 
												first semester of the second year, I was tasked with creating a virtual PC in Azure.  
												The assignment included several tasks, such as instralling oracle 12c and then creating  
												Pluggable Database (PDB) using the Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA), user administration 
												and security, as well as backup and recovery operations.
												<br><br>
												To begin, I set up a virtual PC in Azure, which provided a cloud-based environment for hosting 
												the Oracle database. This involved creating a virtual machine (VM) instance, configuring the necessary 
												network settings, and installing the Oracle database software.
												<br><br>
												Once the virtual PC was set up, I proceeded to create a PDB using the Database Configuration 
												Assistant (DBCA). The DBCA is a tool provided by Oracle that simplifies the process of creating 
												and configuring a new database. I used the DBCA to define the necessary parameters, such as the 
												PDB name, tablespace allocations, and database options.
												<br><br>
												After creating the PDB, I moved on to user administration and security. This involved managing 
												user accounts, roles, and privileges within the Oracle database. I created user accounts for 
												different individuals or applications that would interact with the database and assigned 
												appropriate roles and privileges to ensure data security and access control. This step included 
												setting up authentication methods, such as password-based authentication or using external 
												authentication sources.

											<h2>Analog Electronics</h2>
											<p>Anti-theft System</p>

											<p>
												As part of my analog electronics module in the first semester, 
												I was assigned to implement an anti-theft system using various components, 
												including an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), IC LM741, a 555 timer IC, a buzzer, and an LED.
												<br><br>
												The objective of the anti-theft system was to detect unauthorized access to a specific 
												area by utilizing light sensing and generating an alarm to deter intruders. Here's an explanation 
												of how I implemented the system:
												<br><br>
												I used an LDR as a light sensor to detect changes in ambient light, and 
												the resistance of the LDR varies with the intensity of light falling on it.
												<br>
												The LM741 IC was utilized as a comparator to compare the varying 
												resistance of the LDR with a predefined threshold value. The LM741 compared the voltage across the LDR with a reference voltage.
												<br>
												The 555 timer IC was employed as a timer to generate a specific frequency or pulse 
												duration required for the alarm system. It operated in astable mode to produce a continuous oscillating output.
												<br>
												A buzzer and an LED were connected to the output of the 555 timer IC. When unauthorized 
												access was detected, the 555 timer IC produced a continuous oscillating signal, activating both the buzzer and the LED.
												<br><br>
												The overall working of the anti-theft system can be summarized as follows:
												<br><br>
												The LDR was connected to a potential divider circuit, producing a voltage proportional to the light 
												intensity falling on it.
												<br>
												The voltage from the LDR was then compared with a reference voltage set using the LM741 operational amplifier. 
												If the voltage across the LDR dropped below the reference voltage, indicating a decrease in light intensity due to 
												an obstruction, the output of the LM741 went high.
												<br>
												The high output of the LM741 triggered the 555 timer IC, which generated a continuous oscillating output signal.
												<br>
												The output signal from the 555 timer IC was fed to both the buzzer and the LED. The buzzer produced a loud 
												audible alarm, while the LED provided a visual indication of the system being activated.

											<p>
												For the individual assignment in my digital electronics module, I was assigned to implement an 
												elevator system. The system involved using an LM358 as a comparator, OP817 as an Opto-coupler, 7447 as a decade counter, 
												and FND 507 as a common anode seven-segment display. Additionally, PNP or NPN transistors (BD139 or BD140) were suggested 
												to switch the relays for driving the DC motor, and a 12V or 9V battery could be used as the power supply.
												<br><br>
												The elevator system aimed to control the movement of an elevator car between different floors. Here's an explanation of 
												how I implemented the system:
												<br>
												Comparator (LM358): The LM358 comparator was used to compare the desired floor signal with the current floor signal. It 
												determined whether the elevator should move up or down based on the comparison.
												<br>
												Opto-coupler (OP817): The OP817 opto-coupler acted as a signal isolator between the digital control circuitry and the 
												high-power components, such as relays and the DC motor. It provided electrical isolation to prevent interference or damage.
												<br>
												Decade Counter (7447): The 7447 decade counter was used to convert the binary-coded decimal (BCD) output of the comparator 
												into a format suitable for driving the seven-segment display.
												<br>
												Seven-Segment Display (FND 507): The FND 507 common anode seven-segment display was used to visually indicate the current 
												floor number. The decade counter's output was used to activate the appropriate segments on the display to represent the floor number.
												<br>
												Transistors (BD139 or BD140): PNP or NPN transistors, such as BD139 or BD140, were utilized to switch the relays for controlling 
												the DC motor's movement. The transistors acted as electronic switches, enabling the control circuitry to handle the higher current 
												required by the motor.
												<br>
												Power Supply: A 12V or 9V battery was used as the power supply for the circuit. The specific voltage depended on the chosen 
												components and the motor's requirements.
												<br><br>
												The overall working of the elevator system can be summarized as follows:
												<br>
												The desired floor signal was compared with the current floor signal using the LM358 comparator.
												<br>
												The output of the comparator was converted into BCD format using the 7447 decade counter.
												<br>
												The BCD output of the decade counter was used to activate the corresponding segments on the seven-segment display, indicating 
												the current floor number.
												<br>
												Based on the comparison between the desired and current floor signals, the appropriate transistors were controlled to switch the 
												relays. These relays, in turn, controlled the direction of the DC motor, moving the elevator car up or down.

											<p>
												For the group assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming module, we were 
												tasked with developing a Java desktop application with a connected database. 
												The application was focused on a staff leave management system, and it needed to 
												fulfill certain requirements.
												<br><br>
												Basic Functions: We implemented essential functions that any website or application 
												must have. These included features like user login and authentication, search functionality 
												to retrieve staff leave records, and validations to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
												<br><br>
												Special Functions: We incorporated specific functions relevant to the staff leave management 
												system. This included features such as submitting leave requests, approving or rejecting leave 
												applications by supervisors, and generating leave reports based on various parameters like 
												date range or employee name.
												<br><br>
												Database with Minimum 4 Tables: We designed and implemented a database to store the necessary 
												information for the staff leave management system. The database consisted of a minimum of four 
												tables, including tables for staff information, leave requests, leave approvals, and leave reports. 
												The tables were appropriately structured with the required columns to store relevant data.
												<br><br>
												Coding Standards and Naming Conventions: We followed the coding standards mentioned in the OOP 
												page, ensuring that our code was structured, readable, and maintainable. We used proper identifier 
												naming conventions, such as using camel case for variable names, following naming conventions for 
												classes and methods, and using meaningful names that accurately represented their purpose.

												For the individual assignment in the Embedded Systems module during my second year, 
												second semester, I was assigned to create a smart notice board using NodeMCU 8266 and 
												Arduino. The system involved serial communication between the NodeMCU and Arduino boards, 
												and a 1604 LCD module was used for display purposes. The Arduino board was programmed using 
												AVR C, while the NodeMCU was programmed using Arduino. Here's an explanation of how I 
												implemented the system:
												<br>
												<ol type="1">
													<li>
														NodeMCU 8266: The NodeMCU served as the main controller for the smart notice board. 
														It was responsible for hosting three websites: a user login page, a dashboard, and a 
														notice edit page. The NodeMCU was programmed using the Arduino IDE, utilizing the 
														NodeMCU library and relevant web development frameworks (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) 
														to create the web interfaces.
													</li>
													<li>
														Arduino with AVR C: The Arduino, specifically the Arduino 328P board, acted as a 
														peripheral controller in the system. It was responsible for interacting with external 
														hardware components and sensing the presence of a person. The Arduino was programmed 
														using AVR C, which involved writing code directly in C to control the board's functionality.

													</li>
													<li>
														1604 LCD Module: The 1604 LCD module was used as the display for the smart notice board. 
														It provided a means to showcase notices or messages to users. The LCD module was connected 
														to the NodeMCU via serial communication and controlled using appropriate commands and protocols.
													</li>
													<li>
														Ultrasonic Sensor: An ultrasonic sensor was incorporated into the Arduino board to detect the 
														presence of a person in front of the LCD module. The sensor emitted ultrasonic waves and measured 
														the time it took for the waves to bounce back. By analyzing the returned signal, the Arduino could 
														determine if there was an obstruction (i.e., a person) within a certain distance range.

											<p>
												In the second semester of the second year, as part of the Professional Engineering Practice 
												and Industrial Management module, our group was assigned to create a vehicle anti-theft system 
												with real-time GPS tracking using Arduino. The system utilized an Arduino Uno R3, a SIM900 NEO GSM 
												module for SMS communication, a GPS module for tracking location and speed, and a motion sensor to 
												detect unauthorized access.

												The main objective of the system was to provide enhanced security for vehicles and enable owners 
												to track their vehicles in real-time. Here's an explanation of how we implemented the system:

												<ul>
													<li>
														The Arduino Uno R3 served as the central control unit of the anti-theft system. It was responsible 
														for processing inputs from the motion sensor and GPS module and performing actions based on received SMS 
														commands. The SIM900 NEO GSM module facilitated communication between the system and the vehicle owner's 
														mobile device through SMS.
													</li>
													<li>
														The GPS module enabled real-time tracking of the vehicle's location and speed. It continuously provided 
														the Arduino with data on latitude, longitude, and speed, which were used for tracking and monitoring purposes.
													</li>
													<li>
														To distract potential thieves, we incorporated a display that only showed the date and speed information 
														when the system was active. This display acted as a decoy and did not reveal any sensitive information 
														about the vehicle or its location.
													</li>
													<li>
														To interact with the system, the vehicle owner could send SMS commands to the SIM900 NEO GSM module. 
														For example, by sending a command such as "status," the system would reply with an SMS containing the 
														current location link and vehicle status. The owner could access this link to track the real-time location 
														of the vehicle.
													</li>
													<li>
														The motion sensor was used to detect unauthorized access or movement. When the sensor detected motion, 
														it triggered the system to activate and initiate tracking and security measures.
													</li>

											<ul class="meta">
												<li class="icon fa-clock">1 week ago</li>
											</ul>
										</header>

										<section>
											<p>
												For the individual assessment in the Computer System Administration module, the task 
												was to install and configure the latest version of Samba as an Active Directory Domain 
												Controller (ADDC) in a Linux OS environment, specifically an Ubuntu Server installed in 
												a virtual machine. 
												<br><br>
												Here's an explanation of how I completed the assignment:
												<br>

												<ul>
													<li>
														Installation and Configuration: Started by installing the latest version of Samba on 
														the Ubuntu Server. Samba is an open-source software suite that provides file and print 
														services in a Windows-compatible network environment. Once installed, I configured Samba 
														to function as an Active Directory Domain Controller.
													</li>

													<li>
														DNS Domain Selection: Selected an appropriate DNS domain for the AD forest(slf.lk),The 
														domain name is crucial for proper name resolution 
														and identification within the network.
														<span class="image featured"><img src="images/csa1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
													</li>
	
													<li>
														Host Names and AD Structure: Assigned appropriate host names to the Ubuntu Server and 
														created a three-layer simple AD structure. 
													</li>

													<li>
														Organizational Units (OU) and Users: For each Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD 
														structure, I created two users. 
														<span class="image featured"><img src="images/csa2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
													</li>

													<li>
														DNS Records: To accommodate the AD requirements, I created the corresponding DNS records. 
														This included creating both forward lookup and reverse lookup zone files. Forward lookup 
														zones associate domain names with IP addresses, while reverse lookup zones allow the system 
														to determine the domain name associated with a given IP address. These DNS records are 
														crucial for proper name resolution and ensuring the functionality of the Active Directory 
														services.
													</li>
												</ul>
												
												<br>

												By completing this individual assessment, I gained hands-on experience in installing and 
												configuring Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller in a Linux OS environment. 
												I also learned about selecting an appropriate DNS domain, creating a customized AD 
												structure, managing Organizational Units (OU) and users, and setting up the necessary 
												DNS records. This assignment helped me develop essential skills in computer system
												administration and understanding the complexities of managing a Windows-compatible 
												network environment using open-source software.
